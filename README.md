# Puppy Clicker
This repo contains the iterations of the Cat Clicker app which students in Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree Program build during The Frontend: JavaScript and AJAX section. As of April 2017, these app iterations are specifically part of the Changing Expectations portion of the section. I'll describe each iteration below.

Because I'm a dog person, my app is Puppy Clicker instead of Cat Clicker.

### Iteration 1
The first iteration must satisfy these requirements:
- The application should display a picture of a cat and a number of clicks.
- The number of clicks should increment when the cat picture is clicked.

### Iteration 2
The second iteration must satisfy these requirements:
- The application should display two puppies. Each puppy includes:
    - the puppy's name
    - a picture of the puppy
    - text showing the number of clicks
- The number of clicks should increment when each puppy picture is clicked.

### Iteration 3
The third iteration, referred to as Cat Clicker Premium must satisfy these requirements:
- The application should display
    - a list of at least 5 puppies, listed by name
    - an area to display the selected puppy
- In the puppy display area, the following should be displayed
    - the puppy's name
    - a picture of the puppy
    - text showing the number of clicks
- When a puppy's name is clicked in the list, the puppy display area should update to show the data for the selected puppy.
- The number of clicks in the puppy area should be unique to each puppy, and should increment when the puppy's picture is clicked.
